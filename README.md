# Workout-set-creator

This console project was created to torture myself i mean challenge myself to use old scool XML without LINQ and generate custom workout sets based on the user's inputs. The project is written in C# and is perfect for anyone who wants to spice up their workout routine.

## Challenges
- The first challenge was to use XML without LINQ. This required me to dust off my new programming skills and think outside the box.
- The second challenge was to create a custom algorithm that would generate workout sets based on the user's inputs.

## Usage

To use this application, simply run the executable file and follow the prompts. You will be asked to enter your workout preferences and the application will generate a custom workout set! Whether you're looking for a quick cardio session or a full-body workout, the Workout Generator Console App has got you covered.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to add more hilarious workouts to this application. I also plan to improve the algorithm used to generate workouts so that it can create even more unique and workout sets.
