# Workout-set-creator

In Net7 folder is a shortcut to run application.

Is a console project(meaning no UIðŸ˜¢) that uses xml to generate a workout set for you from your predefined workouts so every workout feels a bit different. As well as gives you prebuilt ones from pros(if pro sport people contribute on the project lol)<br>
Sorry not a lot of starter workouts yet and those there are mostly for testing<br>
Might become full app or chat bot later will see.
